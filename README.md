# Paperless Automation Tool for Mac OS X

Paperless is command-line tool that will help you automate your paperless workflow from your scanner to your e-filing cabinet. That could be the filesystem like Finder or apps like Evernote or DevonThink. Paperless analyzes your scanned documents and processes them through a set of user defined rules. These rules determine how and where to file the document. The entire process is entirely automated so that all you need to do is press the scan button on your scanner!
